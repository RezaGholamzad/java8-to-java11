# What Is a JIT Compiler? : 

When we compile our Java program (e.g., using the javac command), we'll end up with our source code compiled into 
the binary representation of our code â€“ a JVM bytecodehis bytecode is simpler and more compact than our source code, 
but conventional processors in our computers cannot execute it.

To be able to run a Java program, the JVM interprets the bytecode. Since interpreters are usually a lot slower than native code 
executing on a real processor, the JVM can run another compiler which will now compile our bytecode into the machine code that 
can be run by the processor. This so-called just-in-time compiler is much more sophisticated than the javac compiler, 
and it runs complex optimizations to generate high-quality machine code.

# More Detailed Look into the JIT Compiler : 

The JDK implementation by Oracle is based on the open-source OpenJDK project. This includes the HotSpot virtual machine, 
available since Java version 1.3. It contains two conventional JIT-compilers: the client compiler, also called 
C1 and the server compiler, called opto or C2.

C1 is designed to run faster and produce less optimized code, while C2, on the other hand, takes a little more time 
to run but produces a better-optimized code. The client compiler is a better fit for desktop applications since we 
don't want to have long pauses for the JIT-compilation. The server compiler is better for long-running server 
applications that can spend more time on the compilation.
