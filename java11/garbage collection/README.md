# An Introduction to Garbage Collection : 

The OpenJDKhas three collectors suitable for production, another that is deprecated in JDK 11 but still  quite  popular  in  JDK  8,  
and  some  experimental  collectors  that  will  (ideally)  beproduction-ready  in  future  releases.  
Other  Java  implementations  such  as  Open  J9  orthe Azul JVM have their own collectors.
The  performance  characteristics  of  all  these  collectors  are  quite  different.
